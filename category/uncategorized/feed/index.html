										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Employers may find it a daunting task to refine the list of applications and schedule interviews to ensure an ideal selection of candidates to fill new job vacancies. On the other hand, people who are looking out for new jobs will usually spend all their time sending applications on their own without getting positive responses sometimes from the employers. Due to the bulk of applications the company has received, most of them can be left unanswered. Thus, this sad reality can make or break the hope of a job hunter.</p>



<p>Every one of us has come across such a path. We could either be a job hunter, an employer, or both. Undeniably, recruiting is not an easy task. We’ve all been there. Well, at least almost all of us. One way or the other we have been through this path before. The most tragic part of all is when we don’t get our desired outcome. In short, recruiting people may sound easy and swift, but no one can see the rigorous works that are involved in the process.</p>



<p>Without a question, both the employers and the job seekers are indeed looking for a better and faster way to do the job hiring process more efficient and easier. This is where&nbsp;<a href="https://edgeonservices.com/recruitment-agency/">placement agencies</a>&nbsp;come in. The agency further prevents undesirable hiring process to happen.</p>



<p>This agency is simply the human resources specialists’ acquisition teams that are hired to link potential employees and employers at a price. The process is also referred to sometimes as office staffing agencies that will fill the vacant jobs for companies or firms that require appropriate services for the&nbsp;<a href="https://edgeonservices.com/recruitment-agency/">placement</a>&nbsp;process. In this way, making employers save time and cost in hiring. In addition, this kind of service greatly helps job seekers in getting the job more efficiently and faster without wasting a lot of time and effort.</p>



<p>The staffing service will select ideal candidates to fill chosen job posts by conducting interviews and specific training process of the candidates on behalf of the companies that are hiring. Temporary jobs hiring has also been made easier by these agencies because of the manpower pooling system. This is why it is easier to pull out a suitable employee to fill the temporary&nbsp;task.</p>



<p>Moreover, the staffing agencies are completely effective in doing the job mentioned above compared to the standard human resources departments in a firm. It is because of the comprehensive experience and daily interactions with the process. This is also due to the fact that every day the agency deals with numerous companies and job hunters.</p>



<p>For job seekers out there, applicants living in the areas of Thane and Navi Mumbai, <a href="https://edgeonservices.com/placement/">Placement Services</a> can greatly help you in finding the best job. Over the span of time, the country has progressively evolved in both the temporary and permanent recruitment services. The Edgeon Company has built a good name for over 3 years in the staffing industry. The company has greatly helped in giving many people jobs and saving hiring cost for employees. Hence, the company helps in making Mumbai highly progressive city in the country.<a href="https://edgeonservices.com/placement/">Recruitment placement agency</a>, <a href="https://edgeonservices.com/placement/">recruitment agency</a>, <a href="https://edgeonservices.com/placement/">recruitment firm</a>, <a href="https://edgeonservices.com/placement/">recruitment services</a>, <a href="https://edgeonservices.com/contract/">staffing agency</a>, <a href="https://edgeonservices.com/contract/">staffing companies</a>, <a href="https://edgeonservices.com/contract/">staffing services</a></p>

<p>Staffing agency services have come as a boon because it provides temporary services and hence companies do not have to bear hiring&amp; training costs.<br>The biggest benefit any company does have by hiring staffing Agency is that they take away all the heavy work related hiring, training maintaining payroll &amp; handling all the statutory compliances on your behalf while charging you a nominal fee for the&nbsp;same.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Following are the benefits you get for hiring office staffing agency services:</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">a. Flexibility –</h5>



<p>The agencies help you with processes like&nbsp;<a href="https://edgeonservices.com/recruitment-agency/">recruitment</a>, providing offer letters, bank accounts, etc. the agencies maintain the records of employees like their attendance, compliance’s, PF withdrawal, etc. they allow you to have flexibility of hiring more staff whenever your company requires. Once extra duty work is over, you can send back the employee to the staffing services.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">b. No burden of overtime expense&nbsp;–</h5>



<p>Many organizations require more employees for a certain period of time. This is just temporary requirement in the company and hence it would not be feasible to hire employees who are completely new and unknown to the process or with no training at all. In such cases, companies can hire expert agencies to send them the staff that are already trained and meant for temporary period at company.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">c. Reduction in overhead costs&nbsp;–</h5>



<p>Hiring permanent employees in the company could be a costly affair for the organizations. As employee benefits, you will have to pay for sick leaves, vacation and retirement benefits too. With permanent staff you may also want to buy new office equipment or supplies. This could lead to much overhead expense for a temporary period of time. Staffing agency provide employees with no such bondage because they handle their salaries.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">d. Expertise –</h5>



<p>Organizations can hire new temporary employees with the talent and the skill that none of existing member of the staff is aware about. For projects to be successfully completed and executed, sometimes the companies require trained staff and high level of skills. With temporary staffing agencies, that need could be fulfilled by hiring temporary specialist who can help with sudden challenging&nbsp;work.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">e. Reduced training costs&nbsp;–</h5>



<p>As staffing agencies look after all the company requirement of hiring, training, payments, etc. the organizations can reduce their expenses to a great&nbsp;deal.</p>

<p>Productivity improvement is a choice,&nbsp;If you are reading&nbsp;this that testifies that you are open to learning and change but let me make one thing clear to you, I learned and consistently applied it still some time I come to square one, but you need not worry it happens with everybody. Change is difficult but not impossible.</p>



<p>“The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill, the willingness to change is a choice”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1- What you will gain from this article?</h4>



<p><br>i‑You will stop wasting your time instead you will value your &amp; others time.<br>ii-You will easily achieve your planned task.<br>iii-You will be organised &amp; have sense of accomplishment.<br>iv- You will achieve more by doing minimum activities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2‑What kills productivity&nbsp;?</h4>



<p>Before I take you on the journey of productivity improvement let us do some self questioning and understands our activities which actually make us less productive.&nbsp;You dnt achieve more no matter how much effort you put in to your work, this is because,</p>



<p>1- Imbalance of body &amp; mind<br>2‑Doing multi tasking &amp; being busy.<br>3‑Lack of priorities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3‑Productivity improvement steps.</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">i- Healthy body &amp; mind is foundation of productivity.</h5>



<p>To start with productivity improvement the foundation should be solid e.g A building to be strong enough for years its foundation base has to be strong enough to hold the load, now think of your body as foundation and to be productive your foundation has to be strong without which your body &amp; mind will not function properly.</p>



<p>Sleep- Have you noticed when you dnt have enough sleep the next day you feel tired , lazy, you cnt concentrate on any work, you get irritated easily, this is because your body has not got proper rest therefore shows these&nbsp;signs.</p>



<p>What to do?As per science minimum 8 hrs sleep is required for proper functioning of the body, some people might need less but on an average 8 hrs is required.</p>



<p>Nutrition- Your body &amp; brain need nutrients if you are eating any thing to fill your stomach it will only help to curb your hunger and not proper functioning of your mind &amp; body as per science there are lot of foods which boost concentration, and energy&nbsp;level.</p>



<p>What to do? Eat foods like almond, dates , drink green tea which is known&nbsp; for boosting concentration and energy&nbsp;level.</p>



<p>Exercise- Lack of physical &amp; mental activity destroys concentration and energy.</p>



<p>What to do?- Any physical exercise will do, however I suggest you to try&nbsp;<a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5660749/">alternate nostril</a>&nbsp;breathing which I have tried &amp; found effective.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">ii-Avoid multi tasking.</h5>



<p>Lot of people have a habit of doing multiple task at the same time like , talking on phone and working on computer, cooking while talking on phone and they think themselves very productive because they do lot of things in short time but in reality they are damaging their brains and quality of&nbsp;work.</p>



<p>What to do? focus on one task at a time and then move on to another by doing this, you can fully focus on each task&nbsp;well.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">iii- Understanding your optimal working time.</h5>



<p>If you are a student , programmer or writer then probably you know what is the best time for you to study , writing codes or writing articles respectively&nbsp; our mind &amp; body are different some will be more active in evening, some in early morning &amp; some in afternoon.</p>



<p>What to do? you have to understand your best time when your mind &amp; body is active , choose this time for your important&nbsp;task.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">iv Keeping distraction at minimum.</h5>



<p>Distraction leads to lack of concentration which hampers productivity, the biggest culprit is smart phones you get notifications( messages, emails, calls) which keeps you checking your device every 5 to 10&nbsp;min.</p>
